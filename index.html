    <br>
    <p>Hey! I'm Nikhil.</p>
    <p>I graduated this May from Duke University, where I studied a mix of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Classics as an A.B. Duke Scholar. Outside of the classroom, I was involved with organizing HackDuke for 3 years 
      and was a founding member of the Duke Poker Club. I'm interested in markets, mechanism design, and computer vision.
    </p> 
    <p>I am relocating this August to New York City, where I will be joining a Proprietary Trading Frim as a Quantitative Trader. During college, I also spent summers at Jane Street Capital as a Trading intern and at Airbnb 
      as a Software Engineering intern working on machine learning models for better pricing.
    </p>
    <p>At Duke, I was a part of the Prediction Analysis Lab of Professor Cynthia Rudin. I researched new model architectures for Single-Image Super Resolution (think: CSI zoom-and-enhance). We published and presented papers 
      at NTIRE at CVPR 2018 and at CVPR 2020
    </p>
    <p>I'd love to get in contact! You can find me on LinkedIn or reach out to my by email. Thanks for stopping by.
